# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project 
Project Overview:

This credit card fraud detection project, spearheaded by a collaborative effort from Angelneke Grayson, Brannan Geshwind, Christina Esquivel, Monila Khadka, and Nathan Humphreys Lucas, addresses the critical challenge of mitigating financial losses and enhancing security measures against fraudulent activities within the realm of credit card transactions.

Objective:

The primary aim is to deploy machine learning models capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. Leveraging a dataset (creditcard.csv) containing anonymized transaction details, the project focuses on uncovering transaction patterns, exploring relationships between variables, and establishing predictive models for effective fraud detection.

Approach and Methodology:

Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the approach involves a multi-tiered strategy:

Data Preprocessing (ETL): Rigorous data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for effective model training.
Model Training: Experimentation with diverse machine learning algorithms to identify the most efficient model(s) for fraud detection.
Performance Evaluation: Utilization of precision, recall, AUC-ROC, and AUC-PRC metrics for rigorous assessment of model performance.
Visualization: Creation of impactful visual representations to illustrate transaction patterns and insights derived from the data.
Project Deliverables: A comprehensive presentation encompassing the project's process, findings, and the efficacy of the selected model(s).
Expected Outcomes:

Outcome: 

Through thorough data exploration, the team identified key characteristics, including transaction amounts and time intervals, and observed a higher mean for fraud transactions. We found that the random forest model with undersampling had the best precision and F1 score of all models.
